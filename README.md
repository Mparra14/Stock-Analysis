# Stock-Analysis
## Purpose 
The main purpose for this project was to help steve analyze various stocks to help his parent find a green energy stock that would be worth their investment. In order to help Steve break down all the data, we had to create a code through VBA and have it be automated for Steve to use. The code we created would help steve visualize which stock had the most daily volume of trades, and the highest yearly percentage return. Once the code does a run through it will be able to calculate through thousands of data and find which stock would be the best to invest in based on the yearly return.
