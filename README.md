# Stock-Analysis
## Purpose 
The main purpose for this project was to help Steve analyze various stocks to help his parent find a green energy stock that would be worth their investment. In order to help Steve break down all the data, we had to create a code through VBA and have it be automated for Steve to use. The code we created would help steve visualize which stock had the most daily volume of trades, and the highest yearly percentage return. Once the code does a run through it will be able to calculate through thousands of data and find which stock would be the best to invest in based on the yearly return. We were able to do this for both the years of 2017 and 2018. 
In order to make the original code more effective we have refactored the code for it work more efficiently provided more data is collected, the code can be reused and it may help with the execution time of each year. 
## Results 
In our code, we refactored it by creating an index variable that would be able to go through all arrays, this helps the code become more efficient since it now has an index that is able to decrease the speed of locating the array and data in each array. Please see below for our newly improved code.
